                "option_a_result": "INCORRECT - While reassigning the module to a senior developer might solve the immediate problem, it doesn't address the underlying competency gap in the junior developers, which could become a recurring issue. It also potentially overloads senior staff. This is a temporary fix, not a long-term solution for team development.",
                "option_b_result": "CORRECT - In the 'Control Resources' process, when a competency gap is identified for human resources, the most sustainable and beneficial action is to invest in targeted training or mentoring. This directly addresses the root cause of the underperformance, builds the team's capabilities, improves long-term project efficiency, and fosters professional growth. This approach aligns with team development within resource management and provides a lasting solution to the competency gap. It empowers the existing team.",
                "option_c_result": "INCORRECT - Outsourcing is a drastic and often costly measure. It should be considered if internal solutions are not feasible or if the gap is too significant to bridge within the project timeframe. However, for a competency gap that can be addressed with training, it's not the most efficient or 'best' solution, as it bypasses internal team development.",
                "option_d_result": "INCORRECT - Adjusting the project schedule is a reactive measure that accommodates the delay but does not resolve the root cause of the competency gap. It essentially accepts inefficiency without addressing it, potentially leading to further delays in future tasks requiring similar skills. This is a symptom management approach, not a problem-solving one.",

Within the Control Resources process, when team members lack necessary skills, the most effective and value-adding solution is to provide targeted training or mentoring. This not only solves the immediate problem of underperformance but also enhances the team's overall capabilities, making them more valuable for current and future projects. Other options are either temporary fixes, costly external solutions, or simply accepting the negative impact, none of which truly address the root cause and build long-term team strength. The PMP exam emphasizes building competent and capable teams.",
