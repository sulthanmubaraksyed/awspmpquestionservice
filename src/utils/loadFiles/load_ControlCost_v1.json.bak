          "option_d_result": "CORRECT - A CPI of 0.85 (less than 1) indicates the project is over budget, meaning for every dollar planned, only $0.85 of work has been completed. An SPI of 1.15 (greater than 1) indicates the project is ahead of schedule. Therefore, the project is over budget and ahead of schedule, prompting a need to re-evaluate the budget baseline and scrutinize future spending to bring costs back in line while maintaining the accelerated schedule.

A common pitfall is misinterpreting what a CPI or SPI value less than or greater than one signifies. In this scenario, the project is completing work faster than planned (SPI > 1) but at a higher cost than budgeted (CPI < 1). The correct action involves recognizing both aspects of performance and initiating appropriate cost control measures without jeopardizing the schedule. It highlights that being ahead of schedule doesn't automatically mean efficient cost management and often can lead to higher costs if resources are over-allocated or expedited."
