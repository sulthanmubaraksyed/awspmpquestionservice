This foundational input is helpful, but it is not sufficient for detailed planning or execution. The project manager must now translate this strategic direction into actionable work by defining what is—and is not—in scope.\n\nTo begin this process effectively, the project manager should initiate the creation of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).

Contingency reserves are time buffers added to the schedule to account for identified risks. They are part of the project schedule baseline and are managed by the project manager to ensure that the schedule remains realistic and achievable, even when risks materialize.\n\nIn this scenario, since client feedback delays are a documented issue in similar past projects, the project manager should proactively address this by adding a contingency reserve specific to this activity.

The Project Scope Statement includes sections for both assumptions and constraints. While assumptions can lead to risks if they prove false, their initial documentation as *assumptions* is in the Project Scope Statement. This distinction between an assumption and a risk is important. Option C is the direct and correct answer for initial documentation. The difficulty lies in differentiating between assumptions and risks, and their respective documentation locations.",
