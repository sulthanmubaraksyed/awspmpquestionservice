Stakeholders can range from direct users and sponsors to indirect parties affected by changes in processes, compliance, or technology.\n\nTo discover these \"hidden\" or less obvious stakeholders, project managers rely on various data gathering techniques. While reviewing organizational charts and project documents helps identify obvious stakeholders, more interactive techniques are essential to uncover others.\n\nAmong these, interviews and brainstorming sessions with key individuals and subject matter experts prove particularly effective. These techniques encourage open dialogue and knowledge sharing, revealing stakeholders who might otherwise be overlooked. Interviews allow the project manager to ask targeted questions and probe for information about roles, influences, and relationships within and outside the organization.\n\nAdditionally, stakeholder analysis workshops or facilitated group discussions can surface hidden stakeholders through collective input and cross-functional perspectives.\n\nBy employing such interactive and qualitative data gathering methods, the project manager gains a comprehensive understanding of the stakeholder landscape. This enables the development of more robust engagement strategies, ensuring all relevant parties are considered and effectively managed throughout the project lifecycle."

At this early stage—within the Initiating Process Group—the project manager’s primary focus shifts to identifying stakeholders. This step is crucial, as understanding who may affect or be affected by the project will shape the communication strategy, influence risk management, and guide overall project planning.\n\nThe most appropriate initial step in the Identify Stakeholders process is to review the project charter and other available business documents such as business case, contracts, or agreements. These documents often contain important context, objectives, known sponsors, customers, regulators, and other parties with vested interests in the project's outcome.\n\nOnce key information is extracted from these sources, the project manager can begin compiling a preliminary stakeholder list and move on to more detailed techniques such as stakeholder analysis, brainstorming, and interviews to uncover additional stakeholders—especially those who may not be immediately obvious.\n\nTaking this structured approach ensures that no critical stakeholder is overlooked, and it lays the foundation for a stakeholder engagement strategy that will support project success throughout its lifecycle.

        "additional_notes": "Identifying Stakeholders\n\nIn project management, one of the most critical early activities is the process of Identifying Stakeholders. Stakeholders are individuals, groups, or organizations who may affect, be affected by, or perceive themselves to be affected by a project. Identifying stakeholders correctly and thoroughly during the Initiating Process Group sets the stage for effective communication, alignment, and project success.\n\nAccording to the PMBOK® Guide, Identify Stakeholders is the first process in the Stakeholder Management Knowledge Area. It involves systematically determining who the stakeholders are, analyzing their interests, influence, and potential impact on the project. Failing to identify key stakeholders early can lead to unmet expectations, resistance, or even project failure.\n\nPurpose and Importance\n\nThe purpose of identifying stakeholders is to understand who is involved and what they need or expect from the project. By capturing stakeholder information early, project managers can:\n\nDevelop a tailored communication strategy\nAddress concerns proactively\nManage stakeholder expectations\nEnsure alignment of goals and objectives\nFoster engagement and support throughout the project lifecycle\nStakeholders can range from internal parties such as team members, functional managers, and executives, to external entities like customers, suppliers, government agencies, regulators, or the public.\n\nKey Activities\n\nThe process typically involves several key steps:\n\nStakeholder Identification\n\nProject managers, often in collaboration with the project sponsor and core team, brainstorm and list all potential stakeholders. Tools like stakeholder analysis matrices, brainstorming, and expert judgment are commonly used.\nStakeholder Analysis\nOnce identified, stakeholders are analyzed based on attributes such as power, interest, influence, expectations, and impact. This helps prioritize stakeholders for engagement strategies.\n\nDocumentation\n\nThe output of this process is the Stakeholder Register, a living document that records stakeholder names, roles, interests, influence levels, communication needs, and engagement strategies."

Therefore, the best approach is to begin with a review of internal documentation and expert judgment rather than broad public outreach.\n\nThis includes:\n\nCarefully examining the project charter, business case, and any relevant contracts or regulatory requirements.\n\nConsulting with executive sponsors, compliance officers, legal teams, or subject matter experts within the organization who are authorized to provide stakeholder insights.\n\nUsing confidential interviews or one-on-one consultations to gather stakeholder information discreetly and respectfully.\n\nBy taking this targeted and compliant approach, the project manager can ensure that stakeholder identification is both comprehensive and ethically sound.

Continuous identification ensures that the project team remains aware of all relevant parties, enabling them to adapt engagement strategies, mitigate risks, and leverage opportunities. This proactive approach helps maintain strong stakeholder relationships and contributes significantly to project success by preventing unforeseen challenges arising from unidentified or misunderstood stakeholders.",
        "additional_notes": "The primary reason for performing the Identify Stakeholders process iteratively throughout the project life cycle is that stakeholder involvement, influence, and interests can change over time as the project progresses. New stakeholders may emerge, existing stakeholders’ levels of interest or power may shift, and project circumstances—such as scope changes, organizational restructuring, or external factors—can introduce new impacts or concerns.\n\nBy continuously identifying and reassessing stakeholders, the project manager ensures that all relevant parties are recognized and engaged appropriately at each stage. This ongoing process helps maintain effective communication, manage expectations, and reduce risks related to stakeholder resistance or conflict. Iterative identification enables the project team to adapt their stakeholder engagement strategies dynamically, fostering stakeholder alignment and support critical for project success."

The Business Case serves precisely this purpose. It is a critical business document, often developed before the project even begins, that outlines the economic feasibility, strategic alignment, and the anticipated benefits that the project is expected to deliver. Unlike technical documents or operational backlogs, the business case provides the overarching 'why' of the project. By reviewing it, the new project coordinator can understand the original justification, the problems the project aims to solve, and the value it is intended to bring to the organization or the public. This knowledge is essential for effective decision-making, ensuring the project remains aligned with its strategic objectives, and ultimately, for measuring project success against those initial benefits."
